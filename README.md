# Deep-Learning

Here is a compilation of a range of *Deep Learning algorithms* for various tasks such as: 
- Image classification
- Style transfer
- Transfer Learning
- Predictions 

These are implemented with either [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) or [Fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) libraries - these resources are courtesy of Udacity, Facebook, Jeremy Howard and other prolific researchers in the fast evolving deep learning space.
