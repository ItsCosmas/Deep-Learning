# Deep-Learning Algorithms

Here is a compilation of a range of *Deep Learning algorithms* for various tasks such as: 

- Image classification
- Style transfer
- Transfer Learning
- Predictions

## Content

- [Cancer Image Classifier from Google Scraped data](https://github.com/KenyanGeek/Deep-Learning/blob/master/Cancer_Image_Classifier_Using_Fastai_%26_Google_Data.ipynb)
- [Generating Characters using Long-Short Term Memory/Recurrent Neural Networks ](https://github.com/KenyanGeek/Deep-Learning/blob/master/Copy_of_Character_Level_RNN_Exercise.ipynb)
-

## Getting Started

 - Make sure you have Jupyter Notebooks in your computer or in an online space.
 - Make sure the computer has a GPU for training the models both locally via graphic cards such as NVIDIA or online spaces such as  Google Colab

## Installing

Just open the notebooks in the gpu space


## Built With
These are implemented with either  or  libraries
* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) - The python framework used
* [Fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) - This is also a python framework built on top of Pytorch
